12.4 Payment Through Anaconda Partner. If You purchased an Offering from an Anaconda Partner or other Approved Source, then to the extent there is any conflict between these TOS and any terms of service entered between You and the respective Partner, including any purchase order, then, as between You and Anaconda, these TOS shall prevail. Any rights granted to You and/or any of the other Users in a separate agreement with a Partner which are not contained in these TOS, apply only in connection vis a vis the Partner.

13. TERM, TERMINATION & SUSPENSION
13.1 Subscription Term. The Offerings are provided on a subscription basis for the term specified in your Order (the "Subscription Term"). The termination or suspension of an individual Order will not terminate or suspend any other Order. If these TOS are terminated in whole, all outstanding Order(s) will terminate.
13.2 Subscription Auto-Renewal. To prevent interruption or loss of service when using the Offerings or any Subscription and Support Services will renew automatically, unless You cancel your license to the Offering, Subscription or Support Services agreement prior to their expiration.
13.3 Termination. If a party materially breaches these TOS and does not cure that breach within 30 days after receipt of written notice of the breach, the non-breaching party may terminate these TOS for cause.  Anaconda may immediately terminate your Usage Rights if You breach Section 1 (Access & Use), Section 4 (Open Source, Content & Applications), Section 8 (Ownership & Intellectual Property) or Section 16.10 (Export) or any of the Offering Descriptions.
13.4 Survival. Section 8 (Ownership & Intellectual Property), Section 6.4 (Aggregated Data), Section 9 (Confidential Information), Section 9.3 (Warranty Disclaimer), Section 12 (Limitation of Liability), Section 14 (Term, Termination & Suspension),  obligations to make payment under Section 13 which accrued prior to termination (Fees & Payment), Section 14.4 (Survival), Section 14.5 (Effect of Termination), Section 15 (Records, User Count) and Section 16 (General Provisions) survive termination or expiration of these TOS.
13.5 Effect of Termination. Upon termination of the TOS, You must stop using the Anaconda Offering(s) and destroy any copies of Anaconda Proprietary Technology and Confidential Information within Your control. Upon Anaconda's termination of these TOS for Your material breach, You will pay Anaconda or the Approved Source any unpaid fees through to the end of the then-current Usage Term. If You continue to use or access any Anaconda Offering(s) after termination, Anaconda or the Approved Source may invoice You, and You agree to pay, for such continued use. Anaconda may require evidence of compliance with this Section 13. Upon request, you agree to provide evidence of compliance to Anaconda demonstrating that all proprietary Anaconda Offering(s) or components thereof have been removed from your systems. Such evidence may be in the form of a system scan report or other similarly detailed method.
13.6 Excessive Usage. We shall have the right to throttle or restrict Your access to the Offerings where we, at our sole discretion, believe that You and/or any of your Authorized Users, have misused the Offerings or otherwise use the Offerings in an excessive manner compared to the anticipated standard use (at our sole discretion) of the Offerings, including, without limitation, excessive network traffic and bandwidth, size and/or length of Content, quality and/or format of Content, sources of Content, volume of download time, etc.

14. RECORDS, USER COUNT
14.1 Verification Records. During the Usage Term and for a period of thirty six (36) months after its expiry or termination, You will take reasonable steps to maintain complete and accurate records of Your use of the Anaconda Offering(s) sufficient to verify compliance with these TOS ("Verification Records"). Upon reasonable advance notice, and no more than once per 12 month period unless the prior review showed a breach by You, You will, within thirty (30) days from Anaconda's notice, allow Anaconda and/or its auditors access to the Verification Records and any applicable books, systems (including Anaconda product(s) or other equipment), and accounts during Your normal business hours.
14.2 Quarterly User Count. In accordance with the pricing structure stipulated within the relevant Order Form and this Agreement, in instances where the pricing assessment is contingent upon the number of users, Anaconda will conduct a periodic true-up on  a quarterly basis to ascertain the alignment between the actual number of users utilizing the services and the initially reported user count, and to assess for any unauthorized or noncompliant usage.
14.3 Penalties for Overage or Noncompliant Use.  Should the actual user count exceed the figure initially provided, or unauthorized usage is uncovered, the contracting party shall remunerate the difference to Anaconda, encompassing the additional users or noncompliant use in compliance with Anaconda's then-current pricing terms. The payment for such difference shall be due in accordance with the invoicing and payment provisions specified in these TOS and/or within the relevant Order and the Agreement. In the event there is no custom commercial agreement beyond these TOS between You and Anaconda at the time of a true-up pursuant to Section 13.2, and said true-up uncovers unauthorized or noncompliant usage, You will remunerate Anaconda via a back bill for any fees owed as a result of all unauthorized usage after April of 2020.  Fees may be waived by Anaconda at its discretion.
